# Web3 DAO Platform - Technical Assessment

A full-stack Web3 application featuring a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting platform with cryptocurrency integration. This project demonstrates advanced React development, Web3 integration, and blockchain interaction capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This technical assessment involved debugging and enhancing a cryptocurrency DAO platform for "Vegan Rob's Coin" - a blockchain project focused on addressing global food accessibility issues. The platform enables token holders to participate in governance through a sophisticated voting mechanism.

**Assessment Completed For:** Decentrust (Blockchain Services Provider, France)
**Timeline:** 48-hour deadline (completed within timeframe)
**Demo Video:** [View Live Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/2e8e11578d0e47cbb523f98fc59c6d5c?sid=c57a417a-fb00-4244-b3fd-32e1c68bb918)

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### Priority Issue: Wallet Connection Error Handling
**Problem:** Application crashed when users without MetaMask attempted to connect wallets
**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messaging
```javascript
// Enhanced wallet detection and error handling
if (!window.ethereum) {
  alert("MetaMask is not installed. Please install MetaMask to connect your wallet.");
  return;
}
```

### Issue 2: Missing Election Images
**Problem:** Vote page displayed placeholder icons instead of actual uploaded images
**Solution:** Fixed IPFS gateway URL resolution and implemented fallback mechanisms
```javascript
// IPFS URL processing with working gateway
processImageUrl = (sourceUrl) => {
  if (sourceUrl.includes('/ipfs/')) {
    const hash = sourceUrl.split('/ipfs/')[1];
    return `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${hash}`;
  }
  return sourceUrl;
};
```

### Issue 3: State Persistence After Wallet Disconnect
**Problem:** DAO information remained visible after wallet disconnection without page refresh
**Solution:** Implemented real-time state management with disconnect functionality
```javascript
// Real-time wallet state synchronization
ethereum.on("accountsChanged", async (accounts) => {
  if (accounts.length === 0) {
    this.setState({ account: "", position: "" });
    this.props.dispatch({ type: "SET_ACCOUNT", payload: "" });
    this.props.dispatch({ type: "SET_POSITION", payload: "" });
  }
});
```
